# ðŸ¥” Potato Leaf Disease Image Classifier

This project implements an image classification model to automatically detect and classify diseases in potato plant leaves using deep learning with and without transformer-based architectures. The classifier is trained to recognize multiple disease categories (such as Phytopthora, Fungi, Bacteria, etc.) as well as healthy leaves, helping farmers and agricultural experts diagnose issues early and accurately.

Two models were built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with experimentation on both custom architectures and existing models such as ResNet and ViT. The goal is to deliver a reliable tool for crop disease management and precision agriculture.
